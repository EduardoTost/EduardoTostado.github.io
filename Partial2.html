        <p><b>Iterative Design</b></p>
        <p>Iterative Design is a design methodology in which the product is created in the following phases: prototyping, testing, analyzing and refining. The steps are repeated until the product is finished. This allows for a precision based product in which every deail is taken into account and the product aims for perfection. It is important in interaction design as this method allows us to actually visualize our product and modify it according to the necessities of the end-goal. </p>

        <p><font color = "Black">We accomplish action by achieving our functionality goal. There are 4 tasks in our project. Log in, request a trip, monitor a trip, and review the driver, and they are all implemented in our project.</font></p>
        <p><font color = "Black">We accomplish passion by making our project as "mother friendly" as possible. In other words, most of our clientele will be moms with children, and we made sure that our webpage is friendly for them.</font></p>
        <p><font color = "Black">We accomplish knowledge by utilizing current aplications similar to our project to serve as a starting point. Specifically, we took a look into Uber mobile app to give us an idea of how to implement our project. By utilizing one of the most utilized personal driver services we are utilizing all of the succesful ideas into our project.</font></p>

<p>User interfaced has a simple goal: making the interface as friendly and useful for the user as possible. The methodology I propose for developing a user interface bases itself on user research and testing. The steps would be as followed:<br>1. Research the user group. The designer is not the person who will be utilizing the user interface, it is the actual user who will be having to deal with the user interface. Therefore, it is important to know what the user wants and needs.<br>2. Create a prototype. Based on the research done, an initial prototype is developed to allow for testing with the users.<br>3. Test prototype with actual future users. We utilize a group of potential users to test the product and give us feedback about what is wrong and what is right. There is a parallel interaction between user testing and product modifications to adjust the product to the user's needs.<br>4. Modify prototype according to testing results. The prototype is molded and evolves into what becomes an initial release based on the user's feedback.<br>5. Release an initial version. Stable version is released and feedback continues to be gather to adjust user interface.<br> 6. Adjust as necessary. As users utilize the actual product, feedback about what is useful and what not is gathered and used to refine the product.</p>

<p>The proyect is going along very well. The documentation for the actual web page is finished. This includes the work from partial 1 and partial 2, going from the initial investigation and persona through the balsamiq mockup and proto.io. Everything is set up to create the actual product webpage. I have the design and functionality planned, it is just a matter of creating the code. I would give myself all of the 30/30 points in effort as I am doing the project alone, and 65/70 in results (I have done all of the work, but still have not gone beyond the requirements) for a total of 95/100.</p>
