<a id="personal-motivations" class="anchor" href="#personal-motivations" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Personal Motivations</h3>

<p>The main reason why I chose to solve this problem is that my parents sometimes treat me like a chofer. Let it be early in the morning or late at night in a weekend, there are times where my parents can't drive my little sister and I have to do it for them. My parent's don't trust Uber with my little sister, and public transportation is not even an option in Mexico. 
Another reason why I want to solve this problem is the amount of times I hear complaints from relatives about this problem. Every weekend at our family gatherings they ask how is it possible that given the technology available to us there is still no solution to safe transportation for children.</p>

<h3>
<a id="formal-solutions-previously-created" class="anchor" href="#formal-solutions-previously-created" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Formal Solutions Previously Created</h3>

<p>One of the most popular solutions for this conflict is the school bus. Some schools in Mexico try to implement a bus system for their school, but many times this fails. Mexican parents are very protective about their children, and some of them are doubtful about sending their children in a bus. Another formal solution is using Uber's transportation service, but it may require an adult to accompany the children as no one would send a 5 year old with a chofer they don't personally know.</p>

<h3>
<a id="interviews" class="anchor" href="#interviews" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Interviews</h3>

<p>The process of interviewing a selective group of our user group was very straightforward. We brought up the problem with a parent, and then we would not ask any questions. Rather, we would let the interviewee talk about the subject and hear their proposals to solutions. Most importantly, we would listen to the user's requirements.
Interviews with parents (our user group) gave some very interesting facts about the problem. Parents are willing to pay a higher price for safe and trustworthy transportation rather than using a cheaper alternative such as Uber. Parents value their time and would prefer to have someone trustworthy drive their children to school or other activities rather than doing it themselves. Another important fact gathered from the interview was the parent's emphasis on safety. They want to be able to know where their children is and where at ALL TIMES! </p>

<p>My work in the first partial was good, but maybe not so consistent. Some of the homework I was not able to finish in time due to some family issues happening at the time, but I was able to deliver everything asked at the end of the partial. I tried out new techniques and designs such as github pages, and it has made my work much more appealing. Personally, I think my strongest aspect of this partial is my project, as it is a daily problem with a solid understanding of it. </p>

<h3>
<a id="evaluation-of-partial-1" class="anchor" href="#evaluation-of-partial-1" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Solutions</h3>

<p>Solution 1: Building a bus transportation system just for kids.<br>
Viability: Not viable. This requires us to own buses, to train bus drivers and hire them, we need to fuel the buses and create routes to pick up children all around the city.
</p>
<p>Solution 2: Implementing an Uber-like application just for children.<br>
Viability: Viable. If we can somehow restrict the chofers by having very detailed and specific entry requirements, we can create a safe transportation for children.
</p>
<p>Solution 3: Train and rent chofers.<br>
Viability: Viable. We can select people we trust and train then in childcare. Ideal case would be for chofers to supply their own cars, worst case would be having to supply cars form them which is not viable.
</p>
<p>Solution 4: Implement a system of carpool with other parents.<br>
Viability: Viable. If we can precisely select a group of children who share similar travel routes, we could fit three kids in a single car and that would take only one adult to drive them instead of three.
</p>
<p>Solution 5: Move to a place close to school.<br>
Viability: It is not viable as not every person can afford to a new place. Also, this would imply that there are residences near every school and this is not always the case.

<a id="evaluation-of-partial-1" class="anchor" href="#evaluation-of-partial-1" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Best Solution</h3>
<p>The solution chosen was implementing an Uber-like application just for children. With the rigurous filters applied to selecting chofers for the platform, a parent could trust his kid will be in good hands. Also, a parent will be able to track their children's location by utilizing the gps in the driver's phone. Payment would be charged automatically so there is no need for the children to carry money. Trips would be on demand, so there is no need to pay for a full time chofer.</p>

<h3>
<a id="evaluation-of-partial-1" class="anchor" href="#evaluation-of-partial-1" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Metodology</h3>
<p>Once we have the idea of our product, we have to study our clientele group. We need to know what they want, what they require, and what they think about the product. Conduct surveys, interviews, and a research on the study group. Once we know everything about our user, we must create a mockup to see how our users react to it. We need to get active feedback in order to modify the requirements and adjust it to the client's need. After an initial testing of scenarios, we would start to build a prototype. It involves more functionality, with constant testing and feedback from the user group. Here is where the iterative design phase comes into play. We would design, test it with the users and modify the product until a proper product is built.</p>

<a id="evaluation-of-partial-1" class="anchor" href="#evaluation-of-partial-1" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Story Time!</h3>
<p>November 5, 2018. It was a very cold monday morning with fog all over the air. Tracy woke up with the intense sound of her alarm. She took a glimpse at the clock and read "6:30". Tracy swang her hand at the alarm clock in an attempt to hit the snooze button to get 5 more minutes of sleep, but instead pressed the "OFF" button. Thirty minutes later Tracy woke up to the light of the sun. After a moment, she realized she had fallen asleep more than just 5 minutes. She took a quick look at the clock and read "7:02". She quickly got up and ran to her child's room to wake Freddy up. In lees than 10 minutes, she managed to get Freddy showered, dressed and ready for school. The only problem was that the clock now said "7:12" and she had to go to work at 8 in the morning. Taking Freddy to school would force her to arrive late to work. She took her cellphone and opened the UBER KIDS app. In less than 5 minutes, a friendly face appeared in the front door. "Good morning Ms. Johnson" said Ted as Tracy opened the door. Ted had drove Freddy multiple times to school. Tracy said a quick goodbye to her kid and quickly went to clean herself for work. As she was driving her car out of the garage, she took a look at the UBER KIDS app to find out if Freddy had already arrived at school, which he had. She quickly drove to work and managed to get just in time. UBER KIDS had just saved her from getting late to work. She also got a promotion for her perfect punctuality in over a year.</p>

<a id="evaluation-of-partial-1" class="anchor" href="#evaluation-of-partial-1" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Grading</h3>
<p>In general I think I did a good job in the exam. The page may not be extremely appealing in terms of design, but it isn't your normal white-paged with black text document. Utilizing some of github's template I managed to create this site with knowledge learned during the partial. The only thing that I couldn't implement, which I wanted to, was to add bold format to some single words such as "Solution 1". I tried to add tags surrounding the words but I wasn't able to accomplish it. In terms of the content of the exam, I did a pretty good job. I tried to keep the children's explanation as simple and colorfull as possible, without utilizing much text. I explained in depth the project proposal and the solutions proposed, and the solutions are all realistic. I would give myself a 90, as a 100 would require something very attractive design and some special elements such as a video.</p>
