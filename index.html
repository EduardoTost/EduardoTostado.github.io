<p>The main reason why I chose to solve this problem is that my parents sometimes treat me like a chofer. Let it be early in the morning or late at night in a weekend, there are times where my parents can't drive my little sister and I have to do it for them. My parent's don't trust Uber with my little sister, and public transportation is not even an option in Mexico. 
Another reason why I want to solve this problem is the amount of times I hear complaints from relatives about this problem. Every weekend at our family gatherings they ask how is it possible that given the technology available to us there is still no solution to safe transportation for children.</p>

<p>One of the most popular solutions for this conflict is the school bus. Some schools in Mexico try to implement a bus system for their school, but many times this fails. Mexican parents are very protective about their children, and some of them are doubtful about sending their children in a bus. Another formal solution is using Uber's transportation service, but it may require an adult to accompany the children as no one would send a 5 year old with a chofer they don't personally know.</p>

<h3>
<a id="interviews" class="anchor" href="#interviews" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Interviews</h3>

<p>The process of interviewing a selective group of our user group was very straightforward. We brought up the problem with a parent, and then we would not ask any questions. Rather, we would let the interviewee talk about the subject and hear their proposals to solutions. Most importantly, we would listen to the user's requirements.
Interviews with parents (our user group) gave some very interesting facts about the problem. Parents are willing to pay a higher price for safe and trustworthy transportation rather than using a cheaper alternative such as Uber. Parents value their time and would prefer to have someone trustworthy drive their children to school or other activities rather than doing it themselves. Another important fact gathered from the interview was the parent's emphasis on safety. They want to be able to know where their children is and where at ALL TIMES! </p>

<p>My work in the first partial was good, but maybe not so consistent. Some of the homework I was not able to finish in time due to some family issues happening at the time, but I was able to deliver everything asked at the end of the partial. I tried out new techniques and designs such as github pages, and it has made my work much more appealing. Personally, I think my strongest aspect of this partial is my project, as it is a daily problem with a solid understanding of it. </p>
